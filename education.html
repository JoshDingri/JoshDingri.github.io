            <p> <div class = "educationText">Here I was able to develop an in-depth understanding of the computer science field. I gained valuable knowledge of many desired languages, ranging from ARM and C to
          Java and C++. I studied the software development lifecycle from the ground up. Learning about methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall. Furthermore, I gained experience working on large-scale
           applications, both in a team, as well as independantly. In my final year I took the opportunity to study game design, as it became a strong interest of mine. It was here that I discovered Unreal Engine's
           power to bring to life creative gaming concepts.

            hence taking IT (for the hardware and business side) and computing (for the software and programming side). The Computing coursework presented my first real experience making
             a large scale software application, of which I scored one of the highest marks in the year. Additionally we learnt other key skills from this class including Git version control, LaTeX and Python. <p/></div>
