            After University, I was asked by Janus to join full-time as a Junior Software Engineer. I was largely undertaking the same responsibilities, but learning
            additional control systems (such as Control4 and URC) and languages (such as TCL and Perl). As well as gaining experience working on large-scale applications.

            Janus is a software consultancy specialising in technology intergration for Smart Homes. After a placement period I was asked to work every Summer between University years.
            Driver development was the main focus during this internship; Crestron, Elan and RTI are some of the control systems I worked with. Since every
            system has it's own associated programming language, the key skill for this job was adaptivity. I was able to learn and switch
            between various languages often, such as C#, Lua and Javascript.

            Punting is a huge part of the Cambridge culture. During this year I worked as a Punting Chauffer for the highly reputable company "Scudamores". The job involved independant studying of Cambridge's rich history to be
            able to construct a perfect river tour. Confidence was the key skill needed for this job, as it involved professionally speaking to large groups of people.
