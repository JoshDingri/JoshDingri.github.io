  My name is Joshua Dingri, I'm a recent graduate from the University of Nottingham, from which I received a first-class BSc in Computer Science.
  I have great knowledge with a variety of languages including C++, Java, PHP and Javascript. During University I developed a strong interest in game
  developement, and continued on to gain experience with Unreal Engine. I also have a keen interest with web development, specifically front-end. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, and creating
  my own personal projects (like the site you're on right now!).
