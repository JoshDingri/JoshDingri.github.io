    My name is Joshua Dingri, I'm a recent graduate from the University of Nottingham, from which I received a first-class BSc in Computer Science.
    I have great knowledge with a variety of languages including C++, Java, PHP and Javascript. Throughout University I developed a strong interest in game
    developement and gained experience with Unreal Engine. I also have a keen interest in web development, specifically front-end. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, and like to create
    my own personal projects. I'm a hard-working person and believe that determination is the key to succeess.

    <br/><br/>When I'm not programming you'll probably find me at the gym, boxing or playing football. I think it's important to keep the body in good health, "otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear".
       <br/><br/>I'm a live music enthusiast and avid festival goer, I will never never pass up the opportunity to have a good time!
